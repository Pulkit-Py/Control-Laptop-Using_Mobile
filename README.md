First of all, you need a laptop and mobile with python installed on both of the devices and connect both the device with the same server that creates a connection between both the device and by using the python socket programming we connect both the device using the same server IP and perform a task using an if-else statement that looks too hard to understand but it's so simple to implement the code let's have a look at server-side code❤️ Owner Made with ❤️ by Pulkit Saini For Your Support:- Subscribe to my YouTube Channel:- https://www.youtube.com/pulkitpy Follow me on Instagram:-https://www.instagram.com/pulkit_py/ Follow us on Facebook:-  https://www.facebook.com/pulkitpy Follow us on Github:-  https://github.com/Pulkit-Py For the Latest update join:-  https://t.me/pulkit_py
